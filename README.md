# Logic-Gates-using-mp-neuron
🧠 Project Description

This project demonstrates how basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR) can be implemented using the McCulloch-Pitts (MP) Neuron Model, one of the earliest and simplest models of an artificial neuron. The MP neuron is a threshold-based binary classifier that forms the foundation of modern neural networks and machine learning.

By assigning appropriate weights and a threshold, the neuron can simulate the behavior of logic gates, making it a powerful way to understand the core principles of perceptrons and artificial intelligence.

This project serves as an excellent starting point for beginners to learn how biological neurons inspired modern AI systems and how logical decision-making can be represented mathematically through neural computation.
